# 0.1.0
> 2017-04-06

This is the initial release of `passablewords`! It does these things:

- Checks for password length
- Checks to see if a password is one of the most common million passwords
- Checks to make sure the password is random enough

#### Roadmap to 1.0.0

- better docs
  - should document that this *shouldn't* be used on a browser
- any tech debt I've created
